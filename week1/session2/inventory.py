    # 1. Check if the item exists in the inventory dictionary.
    # 2. If it does, increase its quantity.
    # 3. If not, add the item to the inventory with the given quantity.

# Function to view all items in the inventory

        #    and then call the add_item function.
        # 2. If the choice is '2', call the view_inventory function.
        # 3. If the choice is '3', prompt the user to enter an item name and new quantity,
        #    and then call the update_item function.
